##Design Detailed Document (DDD) 

-Description of the work
	
	This is my website where you can find information about me, as well as a detailed report on the Computer
	Engineering degree at UFV. Specifically, there will be a section that dives into the subject "Fundamentals
	of Computer Engineering. Additionally, you will find a page where you can get information about Medical
	Robots. Finally, there will be a section where youcan contact with me sending your contact info, and another
	section where you can visit my classmates websites!!

	Hope you like it!!

-Problems during the development
	
	The most complicated thing, I would bet, has been the style.css. Until you fully understand it, it´s hard to
	know what you want for your page r how to create the containers. Also, the most tedious part has been putting
	the infomration about the course into different tables or lists...

-Conclusions
	
	It has been fun beig able to create a website. In retrospect, I see how many more complex things can be done
	and the depth of the HTML language. It´s been quite a challenge, and I´m excited to keep diving deeper and
	learning more about programming languages.
