        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>In 2024, a unique surgery took place in Beijing, China, where a team led by Dr. Zhang Xu removed cancerous tissue from a patient’s prostate. Surprisingly, 
        the lead surgeon performed the operation from Rome, more than 8000 kilometers away, using robotic arms that copied his movements. This achievement demonstrates 
        the potential of medical robotics, allowing surgeons to work remotely with great accuracy. It raises important questions, such as how these advancements were made,
        the origins of the technology, the types of robots used, their effectiveness, current and future value, and possible risks for patients. Medical robotics is seen as 
        a key area for improving healthcare and saving lives globally.</p>

        <h2>Robots Overview</h2>
        <h4>Main Concepts</h4>
        <p>To understand medical robotics, it is important to first define key concepts. An <b>automaton</b> is a machine designed to mimic human behavior, first created to automate tasks
        and reduce human effort. While limited to their specific functions, automatons have existed since ancient times. Notable examples include the “Digesting Duck” by Jacques de Vaucanson (1738)
        and “The Turk” by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1770), which played chess and solved complex mathematical problems.</p>
        <p>The term <b>robot</b> originates from the Czech word robota (forced labor), first used by Karel Čapek in 1920 to describe artificial beings that perform repetitive tasks. Robots are programmable machines 
        that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, interacting with their environment using mechanical components, sensors, and control systems.</p>
        <p><b>Robotics</b>, the study and development of robots, was coined by Isaac Asimov in 1942. He introduced the "Three Laws of Robotics" to govern robot ethics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Robots must not harm humans or allow harm through inaction.</li><br>
            <li>Robots must obey human orders unless they conflict with the First Law.</li><br>
            <li>Robots must protect themselves unless this conflicts with the First or Second Law.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Modern robotics began with <b>Unimate</b>, the first industrial robot, created in 1954 and used in 1961 for repetitive tasks in manufacturing. Robotics has since expanded into medicine, space exploration,
        and personal assistance, advancing further with <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>. AI simulates human intelligence to enable robots to reason, learn, and make decisions without human input, creating 
        autonomous systems capable of adapting to their environment</p>
        <p>Another key concept is <b>automated</b> planning, which uses AI to optimize resource and task allocation, aiming to achieve goals, lower costs, and improve efficiency through better scheduling. 
        Together, these concepts form the foundation for advancements in medical robotics and beyond.</p><br>
        <h4>Control Systems</h4>
        <p>To understand medical robotics, it is essential to know about control systems and their basic components. A control system is a set of mechanisms designed to manage and ensure the correct 
        functioning of another system. It operates by maintaining a constant value over time, comparing the actual output with the desired output, and taking corrective actions to minimize errors.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of control systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open-loop Systems: These do not use feedback and perform actions without considerinh the output.</li><br>
            <li>Closed-loop Systems: These use feedback to continuosly adjust actions and maintain the desired output.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Control systems components include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sensors:</b> Measure data from the process or enviroment. Accurate measurement is crucial as errors can affect the whole system.</li><br>
            <li><b>Actuators:</b> Carry out actions based on instructions from the controller, operating machines or performing tasks.</li><br>
            <li><b>Controllers:</b> Act as the system´s brain, making decisions based on sensor data to maintain the desired state.</li><br>
            <li><b>Plant:</b> The primary component that receives control signals from actuators and produces the output.</li><br>
            <li><b>Feedback systems:</b> Ensure proper functioning by comparing real output with the desired output.</li><br>
            <li><b>User Interface:</b> Allows operators to interact with the control system.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Evolution of Robots since their creation</h2>
        <p>The development of medical robots has been shaped by several key innovations since the 1950s-1960s. Below are examples of early robots and their contributions to medical robotics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Shakey the Robot (1966):</b> Created at Stanford University, it was the first robot capable of reasoning and decision-making, using General Problem Solver (GPS) and automated planning.
            Shakey's ability to analyze sensor data paved the way for future medical robots to use data for decision-making.</li><br>
            <li><b>Stanford Arm (1969):</b> Also developed at Stanford, it was the first robotic arm controlled by a computer. This showcased the potential for precision and accuracy in robotic movements, 
            which are crucial for medical robots used in tasks like surgery.</li><br>
            <li><b>Cyberknife (2001):</b> Designed by Accuray Inc, it combined robotics with radiation therapy, enabling non-invasive targeting of tumors with extreme precision.
            It continues to influence the integration of robotics in healthcare for targeted interventions.</li><br>
            <li><b>RISE Robotic Arm (2008):</b> Created at Tokyo University, it utilized Artificial Intelligence and touch-sensitive sensors to adjust its movements based on feedback.
            This technology became the foundation for surgical and rehabilitation robots requiring precision and adaptability.</li><br>
            <li><b>Hinotori (2020):</b> Developed by Medicaroid, it is designed for minimally invasive surgeries with precise control, ergonomic handling, and 3D high-definition visuals.
            Its development also supports training for surgeons through partnerships with European institutions.</li><br>
        </ul>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Remote-Controlled Surgery</h2>
        <p><b>Remote-Controlled Surgery (Telesurgery)</b> allows surgeons to perform operations from a different location using robotic systems and advanced telecommunication technology. Robotic arms 
        equipped with precision instruments like scalpels, clamps, and cauterizing tools are controlled via a computer console that provides real-time, high-definition 3D visuals of the surgical area.</p>
        <h5>Key Benefits:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables surgeons to operate on patients in remote regions where specialized care might not be available.</li><br>
            <li>Offers exceptional precision, eliminating hand tremors and enhancing outcomes for complex procedures.</li><br>
            <li>Future developments in haptic feedback aim to simulate the sensation of touch, making the experience closer to in-person surgery.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h5>Challenges:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires a stable, high-speed, low-latency internet connection for safety and accuracy.</li><br>
            <li>High equipment costs make it inaccessible for many remote areas that could benefit most.</li><br>
            <li>Specialized training is needed for surgeons, technicians, and nurses.</li><br>
            <li>Any technological glitch or lag can pose serious risks to the patient’s safety.</li><br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Minimally Invasive Surgery</h2>
        <p><b>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS)</b> is a type of surgery that uses small cuts to reduce trauma and recovery time compared to traditional surgery, which requires large incisions.
        MIS offers many benefits, such as less pain after surgery, quicker recovery, shorter hospital stays, less scarring, and a lower chance of infection.</p>
        <p>This surgery uses advanced tools like <b>laparoscopes</b>, which are small tubes with a camera and light, allowing surgeons to see inside the body on a monitor. 
        Instruments like clamps or scissors are inserted through small cuts to do the surgery. Robotic systems, such as robotic arms, help make the surgery more precise and stable, 
        with greater movement than a human hand. MIS is often combined with remote-controlled surgery, where a surgeon controls the robots from a console, using a monitor to guide the procedure.</p>
        <p>However, MIS has challenges. Surgeons need special training, and not all patients can undergo this type of surgery. A patient’s medical history or condition may affect whether they are suitable or not for MIS.</p>
        <p>MIS continues to improve as technology develops. In the future, artificial intelligence (AI) could play a key role, making surgeries more precise by analyzing real-time data, aiming to increase the safety and effectiveness of procedures.</p>
        <p>As technology improves, minimally invasive surgery is becoming more personalized and less invasive, leading to better patient experiences and outcomes, with even faster recoveries and fewer risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Surgery Without Human Intervention</h2>
        <p>These types of surgeries represent a possible future for medicine, where technology plays a bigger role. However, this future is still far off because we need much more advanced technology than we have today.
        To perform surgery without a human surgeon, we would need robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and other automated tools.</p>
        <p>Currently, technology can only handle basic tasks, like cutting and stitching, during surgery. For surgery without human intervention to become possible, there are two main areas that need major development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Surgical Robots:</b> One of the most advanced surgical robots is the Da Vinci system, which can perform minimally invasive surgeries.
            The robot is controlled by a surgeon from a console and uses its arms to make precise, controlled movements, reducing human error. 
            The latest version, the Da Vinci 5, released in March 2024, has improved features like Force Feedback technology for better control, 3D imaging for clear vision during surgery,
             and AI-driven insights for better outcomes.</li><br>
            <li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> AI is essential for these surgeries. It can analyze large amounts of data, like medical images, to help detect abnormalities and create accurate diagnoses.
            AI can also create a personalized surgery plan based on a patient's health and physical condition. By predicting the best actions and reducing human error, AI can improve surgery outcomes and 
            make procedures more efficient.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>For surgery without human intervention to become a reality, these technologies must continue to evolve and improve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Usage and Potential Evolution</h2>
        <p>In the last few decades, robots have greatly impacted various industries, especially healthcare and surgery. Robotic surgery systems, like the "Da Vinci" system, allow for less invasive,
         more precise procedures, making recovery easier for patients and improving surgical outcomes.</p>
        <p>Robots in medicine are not limited to surgery. They are also used in rehabilitation to help patients recover more quickly. For example, the robot <b>ROBERT</b>, developed by <b>KUKA</b>,
         helps patients with mobility issues by mimicking therapeutic movements, like lifting a leg, and repeating them as needed to aid in recovery.</p>
        <p>Looking to the future, combining medical robots with new technologies like remote monitoring is expected to advance healthcare even more. 
        Robots are also being used to improve care for elderly people, such as <b>Paro</b>, a robot shaped like a seal that provides companionship and helps reduce loneliness.</p>
        <p>The current focus in medical robotics is to make these robots more efficient, reduce their high costs, train people to use them effectively, and address ethical concerns to ensure patient safety</p>
