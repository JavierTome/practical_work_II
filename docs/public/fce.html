        <h2>Subject Description</h2>
        <p><b>"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering"</b> aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both
            academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
            this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
            role of a computer engineer in today's society.
            </p>
        <p>The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
            develop practical skills.</p>
        <p>The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
                Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
                and ethical foundations.</li><br>
            <li>Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.</li><br>
            <li>Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
                computer systems and applications.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
            development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
            to the course.</p>
        <p>Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
            basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
            written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
            project of the University</p>
